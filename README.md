# Code and Data Description

This repository contains the scripts and data used to calculate the Defense-Repair-Adjustment mechanism scores, spectral endpoint, Stem Stress Index, and joint latent alignment described in the study. Spectral data is available via https://pan.baidu.com/s/1UYbh4blIlpiI6N1kIyg07A?pwd=nrwm.

## 1. Overview

The code supports three main analytical steps:
1. Construction of the Defense-Repair-Adjustment mechanism scores from metabolite data.
2. Extraction of the mechanism-associated optical readout, defined as Endpoint S, from the trained spectral model.
3. Cross-domain alignment between the biological mechanism structure and tissue-scale spectral information, including SSI construction and JLM analysis.

The complete workflow links metabolomic mechanism scores, hyperspectral data, and model-derived optical readouts to evaluate whether the internal stem Cd stress mechanism can be traced by tissue-scale optical signals.
